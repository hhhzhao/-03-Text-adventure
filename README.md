# 03-Text-adventure
We are building a text-adventure game!!

The game I am writing is about nightmare. At midnight when you fall asleep. You are entering the nightmare.
In the front of you, there is a building. You have to enter the building so that you can go to the heaven. 
The game engine I used is what we created during the class. I learned how to make functions and call them. 
I know how to combine them together in order to have a great gaming experience. To improve more about my game, I would like to import some sound effect so that it will be more interesting. I hope in the future I will learn more skills about the user interface so that the game will be more attracting. 


Hope you guys will enjoy it!
