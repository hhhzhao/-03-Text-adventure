Project: 03 ~ Text Adventure
Peer's repository: Hua Zhao @ https://github.com/hhhzhao/03-Text-adventure

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 > I learned that you could keep the .json as one document and simply refer back to it.
    (This is probably common knowledge, but I'm bad at doing things.)
 > What's more, I saw that you could simply render the whole message with a single command!
    (Hua did this with a render() command and it actually blew my mind.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 > I want to be able to develop the initiative to make functions that can make everything more
   concise.  My own code is rather massive, and the area that renders what the players sees and
   knows is rather messy...
    (To be fair, I never ultimately finished it, but that probably wouldn't have changed.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 > My only suggestion is to give a bit more flavor to the areas.  Have a "look" function that could give the player
   more detail as to what the place actually is or looks like beyond the opening impression.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What could have been clearer or better commented?

 > In the render function, the docstring would have been easier to find and absorb if it were in
   the first line of the body, but that's a nitpick; most everything is clear as is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 > I was confused by how logging works, but that's just because I probably don't have a good understanding of it.
   I trust that it was used well here.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 > It does; the right name's there and everything.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 > It's decent as is, but if I had to suggest something, you could probably give a bit more detail on how
   you came to accomplish what you did.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

 > I love how succinct and neat everything is.  You did stuff I couldn't have hoped to at the
   time (like the render() function).  Good work!
